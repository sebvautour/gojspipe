# gojspipe
gojspipe is a Javascript execution pipeline that runs a series of scripts.

The [robertkrimen/otto](https://github.com/robertkrimen/otto) package is used as the Javascipt VM. If you just need a Javascript VM (no pipeline feature), concider using that package directly.


## Usage
See the [ExamplePipeline](pipeline_test.go) code.
